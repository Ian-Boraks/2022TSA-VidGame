I have never done this set up before. It might be really good or really bad. :+1:

This. This a thousand times over. My typical project when it goes to play loads:

- a scene for the UI (sometimes a few scenes for this)
- a scene for the player control
- a scene to drive the enemy
- content scenes (at least one, sometimes multiple, such as one for lighting, etc.)
- sometimes a debug control scene in the editor

The Player and Enemy managers just hang around waiting for spawn points to appear in scene (checking each frame until they do), then when the level content has finished loading, off it goes.

This way you have far less chance of a conflict editing a scene.

And if you have a prefab that is used in only one scene, DO NOT USE A PREFAB! If it never has to appear in more than one scene, you're just increasing the surface area where you can cause errors by having two files (the prefab and the one scene that uses it) have to remain in perfect synchrony. ONLY use prefabs if an object is going to be referenced in multiple scenes, or loaded at runtime.
